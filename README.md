Woosung Kang, Jinkyu Lee, Youngmoon Lee, Sangeun Oh, Kilho Lee, Hoon Sung Chwa
To appear in 30th IEEE Real-Time Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS 2024), Hong Kong, China, May 2024

## Darknet vs. PyTorch
RT-Swap based on PyTorch can be found on "main" branch\
RT-Sawp based on Darknet can be found on "darknet" branch


## Prerequisites
RT-Swap is comaptible with ML frameowrks that support CUDA 10.2 or higher due to the availability of CUDA low-level GPU VMM APIs.

## Code Organization


## How to Run
